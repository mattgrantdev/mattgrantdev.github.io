Welcome to the GitHub repo for my Personal Website!

## Where can I find this magical website?
Great question! To visit my personal website, please click [here](https://mattgrant.dev).

## What will I find once I'm there?

### About
The about tab will tell you a little about me from a professional side. This includes information about my work experience, education, and more.

### Vinyl
You'll be able to see both what's in my current Vinyl collection, and what I have on my wantlist. This will be updated from time to time automatically, as I have configured a GitHub Action to pull data from Discogs, and interpret it in a reactive manner.

### My Personal Projects
This tab will give you a little more information and links to the projects I have been working on outside of my 9-5 job as an engineer. They're my passion projects really, so feel free to check 'em out!

### My PS Trophies
Feel free to take a look at my Playstation Trophy Showcase. Here you'll find all the platinum trophies I've been able to unlock, and I'm damn proud of them.

### Gallery
Here you will find photo galleries I have put together from the various places I have travelled in the past. I will be updating this from time to time as I travel around, which will be occurring quite a bit in the distant future once it is safe to do so (keeping COVID-19 in mind).

### Contact Me
Here you will be able to contact me! And please feel free to, as I will read the message through and through, and maybe even send you a message back containing a picture of Jason Schwartzman, cause he's a real cool guy.

## What's in it for me?
I will think you're a really cool person. And I'll give you a high five, virtually at least.
