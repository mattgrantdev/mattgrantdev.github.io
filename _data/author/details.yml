bio: >-
  Hello World! My name is Matt Grant, and I am a Software Engineer based in Chicago.
  I have been coding since my high school days, and it has been a passion of mine ever
  since. Outside of the beep boops, I have an adoration for music, vidya games, da Bears. I play the
  tuba, am picking up the piano, and am definitely a high-quality melodica player
  (this one is just not true). Feel free to take a look around my personal website,
  I hope you are able to find some quality content.
