  My Spotify Playlist Showcase
</h1>
<hr />
<div style="text-align:center">
  Spotify has served as an important application in my experience in music immersion and discovery.
  I wanted to share with you the playlists I have created and will always be adding to. These playlists
  each serve a pretty strong purpose, and each one has a completely different vibe. Maybe you'll find some
  bops. No matter the case, I hope you enjoy.

    <h3>Nostalgic</h3>
    <span>
      Sometimes you come across a track from some other time, one that hits just right but you can’t remember why. Somewhere between the COD Black Ops and the countless bowls of Goldfish I found a strong resume of bops. Paper and scissor machine broke, this playlist is basically all rock.

      <h3>Doin Real Fine</h3>
      <span>
        Hey now, we all gotta take a break here and there. When that time comes, we gotta just sit back and relax.
        Sometimes this is accompanied by a glass of whiskey. Sometimes its something else. Nonetheless,
        be sure to pick up this playlist on your way to serenity (now).

    <h3>Some Excellent Concert Pieces Friendo</h3>
    <span>
      Pavarotti may have saved Jazz, but you won't find the lick here. Sometimes
      you need to just hunker down and listen to some excellent classical music.
      This playlist contains some of my favorites, almost all pieces I have played
      in an ensemble on the tuba.
