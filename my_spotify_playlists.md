<div style="text-align:center">
    Spotify has served as an important application in my experience in music immersion and discovery.
    I wanted to share with you the playlists I have created and will always be adding to. These playlists
    each serve a pretty strong purpose, and each one has a completely different vibe. Maybe you'll find some
    bops. No matter the case, I hope you enjoy.

        <h3>Motivate</h3>
        <span>
            I have a major goal on my mental, which has a lot of moving parts. This playlist contains the elements to pump motivation right through my bloodstream. Music is a powerful tool, especially when it itself aligns with goals.

        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <span>
            Whether it be me going deep into a coding session, going for a brisk run, or playing Rocket League, it’s time to pull out this adrenaline-pumping playlist. All gas no brakes, these bars and intense beats will mold something amazing.

        <h3>Nostalgic</h3>
        <span>
            Sometimes you come across a track from some other time, one that hits just right but you can’t remember why. Somewhere between the COD Black Ops and the countless bowls of Goldfish I found a strong resume of bops. Paper and scissor machine broke, this playlist is basically all rock.

        <h3>Doin Fine</h3>
        <span>
            There are songs that we build an emotional syngery with, and these songs hold a deep meaning
            to us. These songs are so important, they are so cruical to our mental health. Hold em tight,
            cause when the tough times hit, they'll be your homies.

        <h3>Doin Real Fine</h3>
        <span>
            Hey now, we all gotta take a break here and there. When that time comes, we gotta just sit back and relax.
            Sometimes this is accompanied by a glass of whiskey. Sometimes its something else. Nonetheless,
            be sure to pick up this playlist on your way to serenity (now).

        <h3>Marvelous & Evil</h3>
        <span>
            Inspired by the Radiohead playlist 0110. You can set your playback crossfade to 10 seconds, and enjoy this crossover of Tally Hall's two albums, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum and Good & Evil.

        <h3>Some Excellent Concert Pieces Friendo</h3>
        <span>
            Pavarotti may have saved Jazz, but you won't find the lick here. Sometimes
            you need to just hunker down and listen to some excellent classical music.
            This playlist contains some of my favorites, almost all pieces I have played
            in an ensemble on the tuba.
